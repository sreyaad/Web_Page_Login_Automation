# Web_Page_Login_Automation
Create an automation script to test the login functionality of a web page. This project will involve automating the login process and verifying whether a user can successfully log in or not.
## Tools/Technologies:
- Selenium WebDriver (you can choose a programming language binding such as Java, Python, C#)
- TestNG (or any other testing framework for managing test cases)
- A web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code
## Tasks:
- **Setup**:Download and set up the necessary tools (Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and your preferred IDE). Create a new project for your automation tests.
- **Navigate to the Login Page**: Use Selenium WebDriver to open a web browser. Navigate to the login page of a sample website.
- **Automate Login**:Write a script to enter valid credentials (username and password) into the login fields.Automate the process of clicking the login button.
- **Verify Successful Login**:After attempting to log in, verify that the user is redirected to the expected page or that a success message is displayed.
- **Handle Invalid Login**:Extend your script to handle invalid login attempts. Enter incorrect credentials and verify that the appropriate error message is displayed.
- **Test Scenarios**:Create different test scenarios for positive and negative cases.Test with various valid and invalid combinations of usernames and passwords.Include edge cases such as empty fields or special characters.
- **Logging and Reporting**:Implement logging in your script to capture information during test execution. Integrate test reporting to provide a summary of test results.
- **Parameterization**:Use parameterization to make your script flexible and easily adjustable for different test cases.
- **Cleanup**:Implement a cleanup mechanism to ensure that the browser is closed after each test, preventing any interference with subsequent tests.
- **Run the Test Suite**:Create a test suite that includes all your test cases.Run the suite and analyze the results.
